# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project is dedicated to predicting heart disease using machine learning models based on a variety of health metrics. The dataset contains medical information of patients, and the goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using various machine learning algorithms. The models used in this project are Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The results of different models are evaluated based on their accuracy score.

### Objective

To predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on several medical attributes, and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated based on their prediction accuracy, and the best model is selected for deployment.

## Models Used

The following machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset:

### 1. Logistic Regression

**Accuracy Score: 85.25%**

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In this case, we use it to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

### 2. Naive Bayes

**Accuracy Score: 85.25%**

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. This algorithm was tested on the heart disease dataset and performed similarly to Logistic Regression.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Accuracy Score: 81.97%**

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning model commonly used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best divides the data into different classes. In this project, it was used to classify whether the patient has heart disease or not.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Accuracy Score: 67.21%**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It didn't perform as well as the other models in this case.

### 5. Decision Tree

**Accuracy Score: 81.97%**

Decision Tree is a flowchart-like model used for both classification and regression. It splits the data based on feature values and builds a tree of decisions. In this project, it was used to classify heart disease status and showed moderate accuracy.

### 6. Random Forest

**Accuracy Score: 90.16%**

Random Forest is an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification performance. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final classification is decided based on the majority vote from all the trees. This model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting heart disease in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a variety of medical features that are predictive of heart disease. Some of the key attributes in the dataset include:

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure at rest
- **Serum Cholesterol**: Cholesterol level in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Blood sugar level after fasting
- **Resting ECG**: Electrocardiographic results at rest
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate during exercise
- **Exercise Induced Angina**: Whether the patient experiences chest pain during exercise
- **Oldpeak**: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment**: Slope of the ST segment during exercise
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**: Number of blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thalassemia**: Thalassemia (blood disorder) status

### Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into the machine learning models, we performed the following preprocessing steps:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values were either removed or imputed based on the context (mean imputation, etc.).
- **Feature Scaling**: Some models (like Logistic Regression and SVM) required feature scaling for better performance. We used **StandardScaler** to scale the continuous variables.
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Categorical variables such as gender, chest pain type, and thalassemia were encoded using **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding** where necessary.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% training and 20% testing) to evaluate model performance.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on the **accuracy score**, which measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions. The results from the models are:

- **Logistic Regression**: 85.25%
- **Naive Bayes**: 85.25%
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: 81.97%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 67.21%
- **Decision Tree**: 81.97%
- **Random Forest**: 90.16%

From the above, we can conclude that **Random Forest** provided the best results, with the highest accuracy in predicting heart disease.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of several machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. The Random Forest model achieved the best accuracy, making it the most reliable model for this task. However, depending on the use case, other models may be preferable for different applications (e.g., if interpretability or speed is a priority).
